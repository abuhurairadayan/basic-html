    <!-- we will be using the div tag which is a block level element and the span tag which is an html inline level element -->
     <!-- what it mean that the div tag will use all the width available to it while the span tag just use the space of how much content it have -->
      <!-- Lets see here in examples -->


      <div>this is a div tag of html</div>
      <div>this is the second div tag it will render on a new line although the first line has space, its because the div tag is a block level element as i mention above</div>

      <span>this is a span tag</span>
      <span>this is the second span tag it will be written after the first span tag because its inline level as mention above in comments</span>

      <div>this is another div element it will again start from a new line</div>
      <div>this is a block level element containing the inline element <span>span: this text is written in span</span> </div>
